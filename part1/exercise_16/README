Heroku has good getting started guide on using Docker containers. I took the Dockerfile, 
made some minor modifications. Then I did small Lottonumbers App, so it wouldn't just be 
a Hello World. Development was done locally till the App worked. The difference in Heroku 
is that it provides the port number, it can't be static.

Once Dockerfile and App were tested I pushed it to Heroku. Oh yeah, had to enter credit card 
info before I could create new app to Heroku.

> heroku container:login
> heroku create
